                The web, internet, TCP/IP protocol suite - these all work together to bring you the information you see online. Here's a breakdown of how they fit together
                Think of the internet as the physical infrastructure. It's a massive network of interconnected computers and servers all over the world. This network uses various technologies like cables, satellites, and routers to transmit data.
<br>
        <b>TCP/IP Protocol Suite</b>

<p>This is a set of rules that governs how data travels across the internet. It's like a common language that all devices on the internet understand. TCP/IP consists of several protocols, but the two most important ones for web browsing are:
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Ensures reliable data delivery. It breaks down information into packets, sends them, and guarantees they arrive correctly and in order at the destination. 
    IP (Internet Protocol):** Handles addressing. It assigns a unique IP address (like a digital home address) to every device on the internet, allowing them to find each other and send data packets.</p>

          T<b>he World Wide Web (WWW)</b>

<p> is the information layer that sits on top of the internet. It's a system for organizing information into webpages and websites, accessible through web browsers. Websites reside on servers connected to the internet.</p>
 
<p><b>Here's how they work together:

1. When you type a web address (URL) into your browser, it first translates the address into the corresponding IP address of the server hosting the website using a **Domain Name System (DNS). 
2. Your browser then uses the TCP/IP protocol suite to communicate with the server.
3. The browser sends a request packet with the specific webpage address you're looking for.
4. The server receives the request, retrieves the webpage information, and sends it back to your browser in packets using TCP/IP.
5. Your browser receives the data packets, reassembles them using TCP, and displays the webpage content on your screen.</b></p>

So, the internet provides the physical network for data transmission, TCP/IP ensures reliable data transfer, and the web provides the organized information structure you access through web browsers. They work hand-in-hand to deliver the webpages and online experiences you enjoy.
