            <h3>Habit 1: Be Proactive</h3>
            
            <b> Focus: This habit emphasizes taking responsibility for your life and choices. It's about moving from a reactive stance (blaming circumstances) to a proactive one (taking initiative).</b>
           <p><b> Key principles:</b></p>
                <i><b>Circle of Influence vs. Circle of Concern:</b> Proactive people focus on their Circle of Influence – things they can control or influence. They minimize dwelling on their Circle of Concern – things outside their control (e.g., traffic, weather).</i> <br>
                <i><b>Language of Choice:</b>  Proactive people use "I will" and "I can" language, taking ownership of their actions and outcomes.</i>

            <h3>Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind</h3>
            
            <b>Focus: This habit emphasizes having a clear vision of your desired outcomes before you take action. It's about creating a mental map for your goals.</b>
            <p><b> Key principles:</b></p>
                <i><b>Personal Mission Statement:</b>  Crafting a statement that outlines your core values, principles, and aspirations helps guide your decisions and actions.</i> <br>
                <i><b>Visualization:</b>  Envisioning your ideal future success motivates you and keeps you focused on long-term goals.</i>

        </div col >
               <h3> Habit 3: Put First Things First</h3>
               <b>Focus: This habit emphasizes effective time management and prioritization. It's about focusing on what's truly important, not just what's urgent.</b>
               <p><b> Key principles:</b></p>
                   <i><b>Time Management Matrix:</b> This framework categorizes tasks based on urgency and importance (Urgent/Important, Urgent/Not Important, Not Urgent/Important, Not Urgent/Not Important).  The focus is on prioritizing tasks in Quadrant II (Not Urgent/Important) –  activities that contribute to your long-term goals.</i><br>
                   <i><b>Eisenhower Matrix:</b>   Similar to the Time Management Matrix, this tool helps categorize tasks based on urgency and importance, allowing for effective delegation and elimination of unimportant tasks.</i><br>
            
            <b>These first three habits are considered "foundational" because they focus on developing your character and self-awareness. They equip you to take control of your life, define your goals, and effectively manage your time – all essential qualities for effective leadership.</b> </p>
